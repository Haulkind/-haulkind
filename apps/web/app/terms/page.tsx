            <h2>Agreement to Terms</h2>
            <p>
              By accessing or using Haulkind's website and services ("Services"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service ("Terms"). If you do not agree to these Terms, do not use our Services.
            </p>

            <h2>Description of Services</h2>
            <p>
              Haulkind is a platform that connects customers who need junk removal or moving assistance with independent drivers who provide these services. Haulkind acts as an intermediary and does not directly provide junk removal or moving services.
            </p>

            <h2>User Accounts</h2>
            <p>
              To book services, you must create an account. You are responsible for:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials</li>
              <li>All activities that occur under your account</li>
              <li>Providing accurate and current information</li>
              <li>Notifying us immediately of any unauthorized use</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Booking and Payment</h2>
            <h3>Pricing</h3>
            <p>
              All prices are displayed upfront before booking. Prices include:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Service fee (based on volume for junk removal or hourly rate for labor)</li>
              <li>Up to $50 in disposal fees (excess disposal fees are charged separately)</li>
              <li>Any selected add-ons</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Payment</h3>
            <p>

            </p>

            <h3>Volume Adjustments</h3>
            <p>
              If the actual volume of items differs significantly from your booking, the driver may request a volume adjustment. You will be charged or refunded the difference based on our standard pricing. You may decline the adjustment, in which case the driver will only remove items up to the booked volume.
            </p>
